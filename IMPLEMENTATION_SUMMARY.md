# Student Contribution Leaderboard - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a student contribution leaderboard feature for NodeBB that allows professors/admins to track and view student participation by posts and topics.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Backend Module (`src/categories/leaderboard.js`)
✅ Created leaderboard data retrieval functions:
- `Categories.getLeaderboard(cid, start, stop)` - Gets leaderboard for a specific category
- `Categories.getGlobalLeaderboard(start, stop)` - Gets global leaderboard across all categories
- Both functions return ranked user data with post counts, topic counts, and total contributions

### 2. Admin Controller (`src/controllers/admin/leaderboard.js`)
✅ Created controller to handle admin page rendering:
- Supports both global and category-specific views
- Includes pagination (50 users per page)
- Integrates with category selector dropdown
- Properly handles breadcrumbs and navigation

### 3. Routes (`src/routes/admin.js`)
✅ Added admin routes:
- `/admin/manage/leaderboard` - Global leaderboard view
- `/admin/manage/leaderboard/:category_id` - Category-specific leaderboard view
- Both routes protected by admin middleware (admin only access)

### 4. Template (`src/views/admin/manage/leaderboard.tpl`)
✅ Created responsive admin template:
- Beautiful table layout with Bootstrap styling
- Displays rank, student info, topics, posts, and total contributions
- Color-coded ranking badges (1st: gold, 2-3: green, others: gray)
- Category selector dropdown integration
- Pagination support
- Empty state handling

### 5. Client-Side JavaScript (`public/src/admin/manage/leaderboard.js`)
✅ Created client-side handler:
- Initializes category selector dropdown
- Handles category switching
- Integrates with NodeBB's ajaxify system for smooth navigation

### 6. Language Files
✅ Created English translations:
- `public/language/en-GB/admin/manage/leaderboard.json`
- All UI text properly internationalized

### 7. Navigation Menu
✅ Updated admin sidebar navigation:
- Added "Contribution Leaderboard" menu item under Manage section
- Available to users with `admin:categories` privilege
- Updated both `en-GB` and `en-US` language files
- Template updated: `src/views/admin/partials/navigation.tpl`

### 8. Module Registration
✅ Registered leaderboard module:
- Added to `src/categories/index.js`
- Properly loaded on application start
- Added to admin controller exports
